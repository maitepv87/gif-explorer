# React-Fetch-GiphyAPI  

## Description  
React-Fetch-GiphyAPI is a testing lab built with **React**, **Material UI**, and **Fetch API**, designed to explore efficient API integration and state management. This project allows hands-on experimentation with:

- Fetching GIFs dynamically from the **Giphy API**  
- Managing state using React hooks and reusable logic  
- Implementing **a custom hook (`useFetchGifs`)** for API requests  
- Enhancing user experience with accessibility features  

It serves as a structured sandbox for understanding React’s data-fetching patterns while maintaining modular architecture.

## Technologies Used  
- **React** – Component-based UI development  
- **Vite** – Fast build tool and development environment  
- **Material UI** – Prebuilt UI components for responsive styling  
- **Fetch API** – Efficient data retrieval from Giphy  
- **PropTypes** – Runtime validation for React components  
- **CSS** – Ensuring clean and accessible UI
